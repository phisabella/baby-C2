# baby-C2

I built a C2 by following the guide in  [Introduction - Building C2 Implants in C++: A Primer (gitbook.io)](https://shogunlab.gitbook.io/building-c2-implants-in-cpp-a-primer/)

Including a server(Flask and MongoDB ) , a client, and a C2 (C++17)

Known bugs: Error would be thrown if the results have any chinese charactor.
